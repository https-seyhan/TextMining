# This is a fuzzy maching algorithm that I developed in order to find degree of similarities between the NLP classicication accuracies.

Performance Metric

The NLP I and V scraping of the yextThree groups :

1) item name complately matched
2) Paritally matched
3) No Match

calculate match accuracy:
match accuracy per text is between 0% and 100% and calculated as below

Accuracy = (Total number of matched words / Total number words of the actual item) *100
